    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>We want Manchester Tech Nights to embrace all parts of the tech community, so we've got a basic set of rules to help make this an inclusive place.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise
            exclusionary behavior. Don't make exclusionary jokes. Don't even make them "ironically".</li>
        <li>Don't harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
        <li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here &mdash; technology is not a competition.</li>
        <li>Although some events include sponsored alcohol, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol. Don't question anyone's choice of drink. Soft drink alternatives will be provided.</li>
        <li>We'd rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
        <li>We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make technology more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this "has gone too far" aren't.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We ask that all presenters bear this mind and we ask that presentations are kept 'PG' rated.</p>

    <p>With thanks to <a href="http://computeranonymous.org/">Computer Anonymous</a> for the rules.</p>
